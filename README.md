Describes my first interaction with Git repo

I'm Fadare Ifeoluwa Samuel, a software consultant @Jethroltd in Ibadan. 
It's hard to admit this, but I really should have learnt how to use thi,Git, platform a LONG time before now.
You know what they say though, It's never too late to do the "right" thing!
SO here I am with my first edit on a branch from the master!.
Thanks.
